I know you guys have heard it many times but - 
BlockSafe is a proactive platform for everyone's safety and crime detection. It uses blockchain-certified evidence storage integrated with AWS S3 Storage to offer tamper-proof, real-time protection and documentation of incidents for people in high-risk situations.

The features that we have successfully executed are - 

1. A fully functioning unique blockchain service that makes the evidence tamper-proof
2. AWS s3 bucket that stores the evidence files
3. Fully functioning AI model that dectects distress through Audio and Video distress.
4. A fully functioning unique non-contact SOS app that redefines SOS services
5. A convienient Agentic service that makes a call and explains the distress information to the authorities and the emergency contact
